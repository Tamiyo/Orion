# Orion Programming Language

## Overview
This project explores compiler design principles, including syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation, using C++. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with 
writing a compiler to C/C++ (opposed to Rust, which most of my other side projects are written in) and improve programming skills in C++..
